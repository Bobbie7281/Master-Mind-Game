# Master-Mind-Game
This is a game where the player has to guess the secret code which is auto generated by the computer. 
This is similar to the original Master Mind Game with the difference that it uses numbers instead of colours.
The minimum number is 1111 and the maximum number is 8888.
The auto generated code can contain different numbers and also numbers with the same value.... example 5 6 8 9 or 1 1 9 5 or 8 8 8 6 ecc...

The game will start from bottom row and makes it's way up to the last row on top. The row marked in green is the row where the user have to input his guess. The others marked in grey will not be accessable
